# IFB102-Miniproject
My Mini-Project for QUT IFB102.

Side note: If you want to run this, don't. Seriously, it sucks you're better off going through every ad on those youtube downloader websites.

# First up if you steal this and use it in your IFB102 Mini Project you're an asshole, just make some random shit it's not hard dude.
## What does it do?
It rips off every youtube downloader website with a worse GUI and functionality. It rips off waifu2x poorly because it had to be run on a raspberry pi. And it just sometimes doesnt work but thats not my problem.

## Why?
Because I wanted a fairly good grade and this seemed pretty easy and simple.

# Installation
Literally run the `startup.bat` or `startup.sh` script.
Thats it, if you wanna just run the thing after that run `app.py`
